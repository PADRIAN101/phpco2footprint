    <!-- Why It Matters -->
    <h4 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Why It Matters</h4>
    <p class="mb-4">
        As of 2023, the Philippines’ population stands at approximately 115 million according to statistics from the World Bank. This growing population contributes to increased energy consumption, waste generation, and transportation use. All of which significantly raise the country’s overall carbon footprint. <br>
        <br>
        Considering that the country is located within the pacific ring of fire, Philippine’s vulnerability to climate-related disasters can be compounded drastically. Currently. The country sits at the 121st vulnerability index according to the United Nations Development Programme.<br>
        <br>
        Despite being a relatively low emitter compared to other big countries, with per capita CO₂ emissions at 1.41 tons in 2023 (CountryEconomy, n.d.), the Philippines still faces significant challenges in managing its carbon emissions. It can be attributed to the country's heavy dependence on fossil fuels, low priority in government initiatives, and limited public awareness of environmental issues related to carbon emissions.​<br>
    </p>

    <!-- Purpose -->
    <h4 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Purpose</h4>
    <p class="mb-4">
        While various factors can be attributed as the country’s obstacles in managing its carbon emissions, the goal of this project is to provide a simple solution by raising awareness of carbon emissions through a web-based carbon footprint tracker . <br>
